## Usage
### Authentication

This API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. To make authenticated requests, you need to include a JWT token in the `Authorization` header with the prefix "Bearer". After registration or login, you will receive a JWT token that you can use to authenticate requests.
### Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints for managing users and blog posts:

#### User Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/auth/signup`: Register a new user and receive a JWT token.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Log in an existing user and receive a JWT token.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/logout`: Log in an existing user and receive a JWT token.

#### Blog Post Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/posts`: Get a list of all **published** blog posts.
- `GET /api/v1/posts/:id`: Get a specific blog post by ID.
- `GET /api/v1/users/posts`: Get a list of all blog posts (both draft and published) created by the user (requires authentication).
- `POST /api/v1/posts`: Create a new blog post (requires authentication).
- `PATCH /api/v1/posts/publish/:id`: Publish a blog post by ID (requires authentication)..
- `PATCH /api/v1/posts/unpublish/:id`: Unpublish a blog post by ID (requires authentication)..

*When a blogpost is created, it is saved as 'draft' hence the user needs to use the `PATCH /api/v1/posts/publish/:id` endpoint to publish the blogpost*
